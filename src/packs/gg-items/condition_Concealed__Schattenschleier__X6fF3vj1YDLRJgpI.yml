    value: >-
      <p>You are difficult for one or more creatures to see due to thick fog or
      some other obscuring feature. You can be concealed to some creatures but
      not others. While concealed, you can still be
      @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.1wQY3JYyhMYeeV2G]{Observed}, but
      you're tougher to target. A creature that you're concealed from must
      succeed at a @Check[type:flat|showDC:all|dc:10] when targeting you with an
      attack, spell, or other effect. If the check fails, you aren't affected.
      Area effects aren't subject to this flat check.</p>
