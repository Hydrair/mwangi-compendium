      <p><span style="font-family:Roboto, sans-serif">While wielding the Relic
      of the Veiled Fates, the manifestation of your Oracleâ€™s curse becomes more
      intense but also more empowering. When your curse is active (moderate
      stage or higher), you can once per day activate the relic as a Single
      Action to gain a +1 status bonus to all saving throws for 1 minute.
      Afterward, however, your curse worsens (as though you advanced another
      stage, if applicable).</span></p>
