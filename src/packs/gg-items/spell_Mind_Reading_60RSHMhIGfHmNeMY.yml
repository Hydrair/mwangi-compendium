      <p>With a cursory mental touch, you attempt to read the target's mind. It
      must attempt a Will save. The target then becomes temporarily immune to
      your mind reading for 1 hour.</p>

      <hr />

      <p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target perceives vague surface
      thoughts from you when you Cast the Spell.</p>

      <p><strong>Success</strong> You find out whether the target's Intelligence
      modifier is higher than, equal to, or lower than yours.</p>

      <p><strong>Failure</strong> You perceive vague surface thoughts from the
      target when you Cast the Spell, and you find out whether its Intelligence
      is higher than, equal to, or lower than yours.</p>

      <p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, and for the duration of
      the spell, you can Sustain the spell to detect the target's surface
      thoughts again. The target doesn't receive any additional saves.</p>
